## Notes

I attempted to log data into the cloudflare database via postman. While the server did receive the request, the database did not update. so weird!

note to self: to view all requests in the website, go to Analytics & Logs > Instant Logs > click start streaming

## Next time
Look into connecting my locally running worker to the remote worker.
According to Tanay, it should be in the wrangler documentation.
