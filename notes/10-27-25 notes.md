Who was here? Shalini and Isabella and Isha

## What did we work on?

Sensor measurement issue from [here](<10-20-2025 notes.md>) is NOT an issue! we suspect it was some sort of interference that prevented the sensor from measuring the water height in the cup.

## Demo plan idea
We know that pipe measurements are accurate. Since we don't have an actual pipe, we built a makeshift pipe from paper and duct tape. It held up fairly well for at least three minutes of continuous contact in water.

# Demo Plan for Tomorrow
For the demo, submerge paper pipe in the vase and slowly pour water in. View updated measurements on the serial monitor from Arduino IDE.
- Paper x6 sheets (2 pipes). make one pipe out of 3 sheets of paper. Use one 8.5" piece of duct tape to connect two sheets on the short edge. Duct tape shouldn't have overhang. Then, add one extra strip on the last sheet that will be touching the ground.
- duct tape
- tape measure
- sensor + esp + cord
- green cup, glass vase. Destination vessel: glass vase preferred bc we can see the water level

Setup: place sensor on arm mount, stack both on bucket. use duct tape roll as a weight. place vase underneath.
