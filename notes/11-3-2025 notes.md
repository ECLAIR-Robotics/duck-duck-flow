Who was here? Isabella and Shalini

## What did we work on?

We brainstormed designs for the electronics box. diagrams in folder
Box contains:
- ESP
- Solar bank
- temp sensor
- cords
note that water sensor is in the pipe itself.

basic design: rectangular box attached via 3D printed adapter to pipe's top. some observations:
- clear top to let sun in to charge power bank
- box shape is taller/thicker and narrower (maximize volume, minimze width) for stability
- going to CAD some adapter, fits on top of pipe
