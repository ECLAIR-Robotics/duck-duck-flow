create database. you might need to install wrangler. VERY IMPORTANT to make sure you're in the worker directory!

``` bash
cd worker
npx wrangler d1 execute flow_records --local --command "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sensor_data ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, water_height REAL, latitude REAL, longitude REAL, sensor_altitude REAL, timestamp TEXT, comment TEXT, sensor_id INTEGER);"
```

viewing
``` bash
npx wrangler d1 execute flow_records --local --command="SELECT * FROM sensor_data"
```
