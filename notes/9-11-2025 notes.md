# 9-11-2025 Notes

Who was here? Robert, Isabella

We got data to display on webpage YAY (All Robert lol)

## Notes

Create database. you might need to install wrangler. VERY IMPORTANT to make sure you're in the worker directory!

``` bash
cd worker
npx wrangler d1 execute flow_records --local --command "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sensor_data ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, water_height REAL, latitude REAL, longitude REAL, sensor_altitude REAL, timestamp TEXT, comment TEXT, sensor_id INTEGER);"
```

viewing the database
``` bash
npx wrangler d1 execute flow_records --local --command="SELECT * FROM sensor_data"
```

If your changes aren't showing up, try rebuilding with `npm run build` because some worker-related stuff pulls from the dist folder, which is populated from running build

some example commands for interacting with the database: https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/wrangler-commands/


## Next time

Figure out which data to display and display it
