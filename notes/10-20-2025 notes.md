# 10-13-2025 Notes

Who was here? Isabella and Isha

# What did we do?

Got distance sensor to print out time
Verified that running average over 30 seconds works

### note to self: pin order
green D5
blue D6
black gnd
red 3v3

# UH OH
today we found a possible error with the sensor when testing with the tall cup: the sensor gave the distance of the LIP of the cup, not the bottom and thus could not see the change in height of the water inside. the wider glass vase worked, though?? Anyways this means there might be issues placing this sensor in the PVC pipe (which still hasnt come in yet).

## Next time

Finish debugging distance sensor
website maps: make one point on map not 10 layered on top of eachother.
