## Next time
Look into connecting my locally running worker to the remote worker.
According to Tanay, it should be in the wrangler documentation.

to `wrangler.jsonc` add this at the end of the file
```json
	/**
	 * test: connect my local worker to the remote (and hopefully modify the remote database)
	 * code taken from here: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/get-started/developing-with-wrangler/
	 */
  "dispatch_namespaces": [
    {

      "namespace": "production",
      "experimental_remote": true
    }
  ],
```
