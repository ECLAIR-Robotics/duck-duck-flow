# 10-23-2025 notes

Who was here? Robert and Isabella

## What did we work on?

Isabella debugged math for average water height distance
Robert worked on adding the popup functionality and routes for each sensor


## Demo notes for Isabella
largest flower vase did work: sensor was placed on the edge of the table and the vase on the ground.
for now, the sensor sends data every 12 seconds: we might want to shorten this for the demo on tuesday so it's faster.

## Next time
Continue adding routes for each sensor to the website
