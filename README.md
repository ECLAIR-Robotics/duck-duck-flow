### About DuckDuckFlow 

The DuckDuckFlow Flood Sensor is a wireless, solar-powered, water level monitoring device for deployment in remote flood-prone zones, specifically the Hill Country surrounding Austin. We aim to collect long-term water level data and provide real-time early flood detection to help emergency services mobilize more quickly and effectively, ultimately saving more lives. We are currently working on a prototype, which will eventually be expanded into a network of sensors. This project will stay open source, enabling anyone to build the sensor and help gather water level data from remote regions. A separate web app will display this data as a dashboard along with data analysis metrics.
